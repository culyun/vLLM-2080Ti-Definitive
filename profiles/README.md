# Profile Guide

Language: English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

This directory contains launch profiles for vLLM 2080Ti Definitive. A profile
is an `.env` preset for runtime parameters only; it does not include the
checkpoint path. Choose the model directory separately in `launcher.sh` or with
`MODEL_DIR=...`.

The shipped context and throughput numbers were validated on 2x RTX 2080 Ti
22GB cards with tensor parallel size 2.

`launcher.sh` also supports a 3rd GPU via pipeline parallelism (`TP_SIZE=1`,
`PP_SIZE=3`, picked with the `t` key in menu item 3 — see `--help`). This is
**experimental, not validated** against the numbers in this guide: it is
useful when a model's attention/Mamba head counts don't divide evenly by 3
(so `TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE=3` fails to load) and you want the combined VRAM
pool across 3 GPUs, but pipeline-parallel stages don't multiply
single-stream decode throughput the way tensor parallel does, and crossing
the dual-Xeon NUMA boundary at a pipeline stage adds latency that TP=2 on
the NVLinked pair does not have.

Profile layout:

```text
profiles/
  templates/
  qwen27b/
    normal/
      fp8/
      int4/
    fast/
      fp8/
      int4/
    user/
```

Launch modes:

- `safe`: conservative fallback mode for maximum compatibility.
- `normal`: recommended daily mode for stable deployments.
- `fast`: high-performance mode for higher throughput.
- `aggressive`: more aggressive mode with the highest performance and quality risk.

`profiles/templates/` contains optional chat-template presets. They are selected
from the launcher as a global service setting; route profiles do not store chat
templates, GPU devices, ports, reasoning defaults, or tool-calling defaults.

File names describe the intended route:

```text
<kv-precision>-<context>-<mtp>-<message-type>.env
```

KV positioning:

- `fp16kv`: quality route.
- `int8kv`: capacity / balance route; currently shipped only as `normal`
  profiles.
- `tqk8v4`: TurboQuant K8V4 compression route; currently shipped only for
  quality-passed `fast` profiles.

Throughput uses the `4096/128` test shape and is shown as
`prefill tok/s / decode tok/s`. Chinese quality smoke is run before throughput;
routes that fail quality are not kept as profiles.
